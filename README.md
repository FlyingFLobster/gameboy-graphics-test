# gbgraphicstest

I made this a bit ago during some spare time I had, it's a basic program made using the GBDK Gameboy Compiler and its included libraries.
It displays a background sprite (if you recognize it you're cool) and a very small player sprite that can be moved around the screen using the joypad.
The compiled file gbgraphicstest.gb should be able to run on actual Gameboy hardware but I haven't tested it myself.
